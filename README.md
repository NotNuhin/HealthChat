# HealthChat
HealthChat is a project containing a series of ongoing efforts to improve health conversations involving humans and AI (e.g., LLMs). To start with, we release HealthChat-11K and a corresponding arXiv paper in order to facilitate research of user interactions in health conversations in the wild.
