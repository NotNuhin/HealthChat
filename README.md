![HealthChat](https://img.shields.io/badge/HealthChat-Project-brightgreen)

## Overview

HealthChat is a project aimed at improving health conversations between humans and AI. Our primary focus is on creating a platform that facilitates meaningful interactions in healthcare settings. This repository includes ongoing efforts to enhance these conversations through research and development.

### Key Features

- **HealthChat-11K Dataset**: We provide a dataset designed to help researchers study user interactions in health conversations.
- **Research Paper**: An accompanying arXiv paper outlines our methodologies and findings, contributing to the academic discourse on health information-seeking behavior.
- **User Interaction Analysis**: We delve into how users engage with AI in health-related dialogues, offering insights that can improve future models.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a wide range of topics relevant to health conversations and AI interactions:

- **Conversation Trajectories**
- **Conversations and Dialogues**
- **Health Information Seeking**
- **Healthcare Practices**
- **Language Models**
- **Large Language Models**
- **Real-World Data**
- **User Behavior**
- **User Interaction**
